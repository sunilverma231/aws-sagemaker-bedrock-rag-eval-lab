    "# Task 3: Test the Query Reformulation process supported by Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task you understand and test the Query Reformulation process supported by Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases. With query reformulation, you take a complex input prompt and break it down into multiple sub-queries. These sub-queries separately go through their own retrieval steps for relevant chunks. The resulting chunks are then pooled and ranked together before passing them to the Foundational Model to generate a response. Query reformulation is another tool that helps in increasing the accuracy for complex queries that your application may face in production."
